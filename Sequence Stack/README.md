# To Fix Error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol

The problem with your project is that you are using a "C" style exported library in your C++ projects. When the compiler generates mangled names for C++ functions, they are different from unmangled names generated by the C compiler and hence the C++ compiler will not be able to link with the methods imported from coredll.lib.

The solution to this problem is - while including the header windbase_edb.h, you can explicitly tell the compiler that all functions included from this header are "C" style functions by changing your inclusion as below.

```C++
extern "C"
{
#include 
}
```

With this the C++ compiler when includes the declarations from the windbase_edb.h file, it does not do any name mangling for the functions declared in this file, and thus you should be able to link to EDB without any problems now.

# C++与C混编的时候，在c++文件调用c文件时用如下代码调用

```C++
extern "C"
{
#include 
}
```
